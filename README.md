# MachineLearning_Stanford_Coursera

This repo contains all my projects from Stanford's Machine Learning course, teaching by the amazing Andrew Ng.
During the course and activities I used MatLab, because it wasn't possible send the answers with Python, here I remade the projects but this time in Python.
